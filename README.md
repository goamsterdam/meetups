# Golang Amsterdam

The Golang Amsterdam meetup organizes in-person meetups about Go. We try to get
together every 5-7 weeks. We hope to make events interesting both to beginners
and advanced Go users. The meetup is organized for and by the community: Please
help out by giving a talk, getting your company to host a meetup, and simply
coming to the meetup and being friendly to your fellow gophers!
